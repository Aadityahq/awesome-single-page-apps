* **Tech Stack:** You can use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS, or frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, etc.
* **Live Demo Required:** Your project must be deployed and include a live link. You can use free services like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
* **Originality:** Using AI for assistance is okay, but please do not submit 100% AI-generated projects. We want to see your creativity and effort! Submissions found to be low-effort or pure copy-paste will be marked as `invalid`.
