## üì§ How to Submit a Pull Request (Hacktoberfest Friendly)

Follow these steps to make a successful contribution and submit a PR that qualifies for Hacktoberfest:

1. Fork the repository by clicking the "Fork" button on GitHub.

1. Clone your fork locally:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/awesome-single-page-apps.git
cd awesome-single-page-apps
```

1. Create a new branch (use a descriptive name):

```powershell
git checkout -b add-my-cool-app
```

1. Add your project files inside a new folder named with kebab-case (e.g., `my-awesome-app`). Include a `README.md` for your project describing the app, tech stack, and a live demo link.

1. Update the main `README.md` table: add a new row under **Featured Projects** with your project name, short description, tech stack, live demo link, and your GitHub handle.

1. Stage and commit your changes:

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Add: my-awesome-app - single page app"
```

1. Push your branch to your fork:

```powershell
git push origin add-my-cool-app
```

1. Open a Pull Request to the `main` branch of this repository. In the PR description include:

- A short summary of what your app does
- The live demo URL (required)
- Any setup steps if required to run locally (optional)

1. Wait for review. A maintainer may request small changes ‚Äî apply them on the same branch and push updates. Your PR will automatically update.

1. Once approved and merged, your project will appear in the repository and count toward Hacktoberfest contributions if the PR meets Hacktoberfest rules.

Helpful Tips / Hacktoberfest Rules

- Make sure your PR contains original work and is not a duplicate.
- Ensure the demo link works and the project is functional.
- Small fixes (docs, typos) are welcome but multiple tiny PRs from the same contributor may be rejected; prefer meaningful contributions.
- Label your PR properly if asked by maintainers and follow requested changes promptly.

If you're new to Git or GitHub, this guide is a quick reference ‚Äî feel free to open an issue if you need help and we'll assist.

## üê£ For Complete Beginners: Opening a Pull Request (step-by-step)

If you've never opened a PR before, here's a beginner-friendly walkthrough using the GitHub web UI and the Git command line.

### Option A ‚Äî GitHub web UI (no Git required)

1. Fork this repository by clicking the **Fork** button on the top-right of the project page.
2. Click the green **Code** button on your fork and choose **Upload files**.
3. Create a new folder with your project name (kebab-case), drag-and-drop your project files into that folder, and add a project `README.md` file.
4. Commit the changes to a new branch by choosing **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request** in the commit box.
5. After committing, GitHub will show a **Compare & pull request** button ‚Äî click it.
6. Fill the PR title and description (include demo link, short summary, and any notes), then click **Create pull request**.

### Option B ‚Äî Git command line (recommended once comfortable)

1. Fork and clone the repo locally:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/awesome-single-page-apps.git
cd awesome-single-page-apps
```

1. Create a new branch and add your project folder:

```powershell
git checkout -b add-my-awesome-app
mkdir my-awesome-app
# copy your files into my-awesome-app (use File Explorer or `copy`/`cp` command)
git add .
git commit -m "Add: my-awesome-app - single page app"
```

1. Push to your fork and open a PR:

```powershell
git push origin add-my-awesome-app
# Visit your fork on GitHub -> you'll see a banner to 'Compare & pull request' -> click it and create the PR
```

### What to include in your PR description

- Short project summary (1-2 sentences)
- Live demo URL (required)
- Tech stack used (e.g., `React`, `Vite`, `TailwindCSS`)
- Any local setup steps (if needed)

If you want, paste the example Featured Projects table row above into your PR body to make it easy for maintainers to add your project to the showcase.
