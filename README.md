# Awesome Single-Page Apps âœ¨

A collection of awesome single-page applications built by the open-source community for Hacktoberfest! This project is a great starting point for beginners to make their first open-source contribution.

## How to Contribute

We'd love to have your contributions! Please follow these simple steps:

1.  **Fork** this repository.
2.  **Create a new folder** for your project inside the main directory. The folder name should be descriptive and in `kebab-case` (e.g., `simple-portfolio`, `snake-game`, `color-matching-game`).
3.  **Add your project files** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) inside your new folder. You may use react, vue, angular, next if you are comfortable with them. 
4.  **Add your project details** to the table below in this `README.md` file. Please add your entry at the bottom of the table.
5.  **Create a Pull Request** to the `main` branch of this repository.

> **Note:** Make sure your project is a single-page application and includes a live deployment link (you can use services like GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify for free hosting). You may use AI for assistance but don't just copypaste the whole thing as it means nothing and will most probably be rejected.
