A lightweight paint app built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** where users can select brush width, choose a color, and start drawing on an empty canvas. The app supports both **mouse and touch** inputs.

* **Clear canvas** button
* Supports **mouse** and **touch** events

## 🧠 How It Works

The app uses the HTML `<canvas>` element for drawing. Mouse and touch events track the user's pointer position to create continuous strokes. Brush color and width are dynamically updated based on user input.
