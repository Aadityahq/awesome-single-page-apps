# Pull Request Guide (Hacktoberfest Friendly)

This short guide helps you prepare a PR that is easy to review and likely to be accepted.

## Before opening a PR

- Make sure your project has a working live demo link.
- Add a `README.md` to your project folder using the `PROJECT_README_TEMPLATE.md` included in this repo.
- Ensure your branch name is descriptive, e.g., `add-weather-dashboard`.
- Run a quick local test to ensure everything works.

## PR title and description

- Title: Add: my-project-name - short description
- Description must include:
  - One-line summary
  - Live demo URL
  - Tech stack
  - Any special setup steps (if required)

## After opening PR

- Respond to reviewers promptly.
- If requested, make changes on the same branch and push; the PR will update automatically.
