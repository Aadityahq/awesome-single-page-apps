### ✨ About TaskFlow

TaskFlow is a modern, single-page application (SPA) designed to help you organize your daily tasks with ease and efficiency. It provides a clean, clutter-free interface focusing on the core functionality of a task manager: adding, tracking, and completing your to-dos. This project showcases proficiency in building responsive and interactive front-end applications using a modern JavaScript framework.

### 📋 Features

 * Mark as Complete: Toggle tasks between active and completed status.
 * Delete Tasks: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
 * Task Persistence: Tasks are saved locally in your browser, so they remain even after you close and reopen the application (utilizes Local Storage).
